# Q&A
### So this is yet another lyrics website?
Not really. Think of it as a fansourced tribute to music with words.  
Nothing but lyrics submitted by you and other github users, all in one place, free to access by anyone, at any time.  
The end-goal is to eventually turn it into a one big point of reference for all other lyrics resources on the net.
### How did it start?
This project is a response to the sad fact that the quality of the vast majority of lyrics websites leaves something to be desired.
### What makes you think your database is not going to end up being as bad as all the others?
Git. It lets many awesome people with various tastes in music contribute and correct texts for their favorite songs.  
Also nobody is getting paid here for it, it's a hobby project driven mostly by love towards music and poetry.  
Lyrics websites are mostly being maintained by a handful of people, and they all strive toward quantity rather than quality (more content means higher positions in the search results, hence bigger ad revenue). Here we plan to have lots and lots of contributors from all over the world, which should result in the most multilingual lyrics database on the Internet.
### You're just copying lyrics from other webistes because you don't know how to code!
No, not exactly. See, many great but not mainstream artists have no lyrics available online. Zilch.  
We take our time to get in touch with their representatives and ask to share the lyrics from the original source.
### So what's the plan?
Currently we're trying to accumulate as many lyrics as no other publicly available database has. It's easier than it sounds since we already have a few dozen unique texts in the database, and putting together a scraper to pull lyrics from other big resources is not a problem. We don't do that though, mostly because the quality of the database would then suffer, so currently we are trying to get more responsible maintainers with good language skills who are passionate about music. We need your help to grow the database and keep the quality level at its finest.
### This project is a waste of time, nothing's going to work.
Negative thinking won't get you anywhere in life. The big advantage of this project is that you can save the whole database to your disk in two clicks, when other websites can go offline at any time with all their lyrics becoming inacaessible to the public. This makes every contribution to this repository a solid and permanent improvement for the Internet as a whole.
### Other websites will just take lyrics from here and never thank you for your hard work.
Will speak for myself and say that working on this one never feels like work. I can also guarantee that both fans and artists who will ever contribute to this database would do so as a gesture of good will. The goal is to improve the quality of the lyrics on the Internet.  
We'd be happy to know that other websites are sourcing lyrics from this database as long as they retain the artists' credits.
### Are you planning to have a web interface for this database at some point?
Yes. As a matter of fact, we already [do](https://lyrics.github.io). No ads, no ugly miniscule pixelated fonts,
no clipboard injections, no malware or heart-breaking censorship. It's currently just a prototype and is rather crude. Meanwhile, GitHub itself serves as a good search platform for the database. Cloning the repository to your filesystem and browsing it the old-fashioned way is another option.
### How can I help?
Please feel free to fork, add to, correct, suggest a feature or make a request for certain content to be added.
### Do you censor things in here?
No.
