# Lyrics

This is a database of song lyrics stored inside of a git repository.


### About the project

Here you can read and contribute all the lyrics that you love,
including those of your own band.

Nothing but lyrics submitted by you and other awesome collaborators,
all in one place, free to access for anyone, at any time.

Advantages over lyrics websites:
no ads, no ugly miniscule pixelated fonts,
no clipboard injections, no malware or heart-breaking censorship.

Please feel free to fork, add to, correct, suggest a feature or make a request
for certain content to be added to the database.


### Okay, so you want to contribute

Here's how:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add files following the structure (see below).
3. Make a PR.
4. Wait for some good karma.

Alternatively, you could open an issue if it's a song request or just a fix.
