The sound of your name, upon my heart, has left a stain.
And I know that we must say goodbye, but without you inside my heart may die.

But I don't want the perfect rose, the one you say that I deserve,
All I know is that I loved you.
Hold you when you cry, without you I would rather die.

And I have done everything that I could do,
But I just can't keep you.

And I don't want the perfect rose, the one you say that I deserve,
All I know is that I loved you.
Hold you when you cry, without you I would rather die.

And I am not the perfect rose, the one I think that you deserve,
All I know is that I love you...
I love you
