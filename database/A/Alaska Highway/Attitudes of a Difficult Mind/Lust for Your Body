An attraction to such discomfort arises from within
And when all words are spoken this tension is released
This beauty's metamorphoses into a beast

Give in to your heart
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh
Give in to your skin
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your sin

Give in to your heart
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh
Give in to your skin
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your sin

Can you deny what festers so passionately inside?
Slaughter the necromancer that resurrects your bride?
Can these intentions penetrate a lover's lie?
Taste the lips of the moment and allow the soul to die

Give in to your heart
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your skin
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your sin
(Lust for your body)

Give in to your heart
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your skin
(Lust for your body)
Give in to your sin
(Lust for your body)
