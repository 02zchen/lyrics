See our sense of shame and throw it overboard
See our moral compass set to so past bored
I guess conscience really does just make cowards of us all
See us turn a blind eye till it&#x2019;s criminal
See us walk away until we can&#x2019;t walk anymore
I guess conscience really does just make us look like fools

You&#x2019;ve been washing out the faces of your friends again

See us right the ship, take back control
See us fight like hell for the way it was before
I guess judgement really should just come from our enemies

You&#x2019;ve been washing out the faces of your friends
You&#x2019;ve been wishing that they&#x2019;d give you another chance again
