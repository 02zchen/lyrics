These streets aren&#x2019;t paved with gold
Don&#x2019;t believe everything that you&#x2019;re told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hides in the air that you breathe

And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price

Lifetime slave living in a suburban grave
If there was a God
(&#x2026;was a God&#x2026;)
You would be the death of Him

These colours don&#x2019;t run like colour from the face
Eyes roll back, chemical despair
It&#x2019;s true what they say&#x2013; life isn&#x2019;t fair!

So repeat this line:
"Everything, everything is fine&#x2026;"
So repeat this line:
"Everything, everything is fine&#x2026;"

These colours don&#x2019;t run like colour from the face
Eyes roll back, chemical despair
It&#x2019;s true what they say&#x2013; life isn&#x2019;t fair

And in the land of the free
You know, nothing comes for free

I&#x2019;m struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line:
"Ignorance is bliss&#x2026;"
So I guess I&#x2019;ll just say it how it is:
You had it all&#x2013; YOU FUCKING PIGS!

These streets aren&#x2019;t paved with gold
Don&#x2019;t believe everything that you&#x2019;re told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hides in the AIR&#x2013; YOU&#x2013; BREATHE!
