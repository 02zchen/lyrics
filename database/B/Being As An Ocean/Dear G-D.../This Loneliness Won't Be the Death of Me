I swear this isn&#x2019;t the end
But I still feel so alone
Even when I&#x2019;m surrounded by my best friends
Word&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t penetrate
A tree in the wind
I bend
Falling faster into the depths
I&#x2019;m falling, I&#x2019;m falling
Under such depression, I can barely even catch my breath
Words can&#x2019;t mend and love does not sink in
Why can&#x2019;t I see Your face?

Clawing at my chest
Looking for some sort of reprieve
I swear this isn&#x2019;t the end
But when will I feel comfortable in my own skin?

Knowing fundamental truth
Doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter
After such tremendous abuse
Cause I&#x2019;ve worked this ground since my youth
And still, the land has yet to bare any sort of fruit
I&#x2019;ll continue to toil and plow
Hoping one day I&#x2019;ll make You proud
&#x2018;What have a got to show?&#x2019;
As I wipe the sweat from my brow

So tired, so tired of showing Love so deep
That most aren&#x2019;t even willing to feel
See what I&#x2019;ve seen
Open your eyes and recognize that this is real
This season brings darkness so profound
I&#x2019;ve become lost and can&#x2019;t seem to be found
Contorted, racked with pain
I know should feel free, yet I continue to sing this sad refrain
I can&#x2019;t sleep and food has lost its taste
God, I&#x2019;m so sick of this place

Then I&#x2019;m touched
By the hands of a brother
And like a rush
Passing through my exterior
I hear my name
A hush
A son, loved by a Father
I&#x2019;ve been made alive again
