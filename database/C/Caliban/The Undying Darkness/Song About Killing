I&#xB4;m here to kill
I&#xB4;m here to die
I feel this pain
I have this hate
You teach me to love
You teach me fear
But now you&#xB4;re getting it all back
And my reasons are just trivial
Try to run away
But believe me

To die this is your fate
This is a song about killing
A love letter just for you,
Let&#xB4;s make it right
Let&#xB4;s make it clear
No one wants you here

All I want is to kill
I want you dead
The price is too high
My life&#xB4;s too short
I&#xB4;m sick of hunting you
You are my shadow
You are my demon
You have to burn for my joy
I&#xB4;ll watch you burn
So you better run
Before I&#xB4;ll watch you burn
Try to run away
But believe me
To die is your fate

This is a song about killing
A love letter just for you
Let&#xB4;s make it right
Let&#xB4;s make it clear
No one wants you here
