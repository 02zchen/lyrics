A digital murder
Programmed by mathematical terrorists
Outside of mortal boundaries
Silently hacking
A binary plague
Serving information
An algebra of fear

Within the language of machines
Uninfringed my human emotions
Within global systems
Silently moving
A digital maze
Cutting information
This is the hacker
