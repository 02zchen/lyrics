Every fucking day, I have to deal with the pressure I put on
 myself, to outdo myself. But I can&#x2019;t ask for help, I can&#x2019;t admit I&#x2019;m weak. I&#x2019;m
 going back on my words, I&#x2019;m going back on who I used to be. I can&#x2019;t take it
 anymore. Every day I wage a war on myself because I&#x2019;d rather die than let this
 win over me. I can&#x2019;t let this win over me. How can I be expected to help anyone
 else, when I can&#x2019;t even help myself? Call me a hypocrite and I&#x2019;ll be the first
 one to agree. I am no longer the prophet I once claimed to be. I&#x2019;m stuck
 between trying to find where I stand, and what it is I stand for. I am no one.
