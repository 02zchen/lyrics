I never asked for anyone to listen, and I never asked for
 anyone to take my words to heart. I&#x2019;ve let myself become a target based on
 nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won&#x2019;t lie to
 myself. If you&#x2019;re searching for safety you can find it somewhere else, and I
 won&#x2019;t mind. I&#x2019;ve never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
 surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn&#x2019;t give us an
 excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest. We will turn our
 hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.
