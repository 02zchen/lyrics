I&#x2019;ve never told this to anyone. I&#x2019;ve just tried to move past. But lately it seems that my insecurities have got the best of me. And I&#x2019;m no longer in control. No one should ever have to feel like this. To feel like me. Even though the good I have outweighs the bad, the bad is what&#x2019;s leaving me with sleepless nights. I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection. For no apparent reason. And it may seem as if I have all the answers, but I&#x2019;m just as lost as you. I&#x2019;ve spend the past few years trying to overcome my own misery, but these sort of things take time, and I&#x2019;m running out of mine. So I will pray to a God that isn&#x2019;t there, to a world that doesn&#x2019;t hear, to anyone who will listen, to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I would never be. I do not deserve this.
