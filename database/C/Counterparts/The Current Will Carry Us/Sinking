This is the only thing I have worth holding onto. I have
 condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see. But
 still I fight, day after day. &#x2018;Cause this is all I&#x2019;ve ever wanted my life to be
 and I push everything I&#x2019;ve ever loved away to keep myself from sinking. If I
 find the bad in everything, I can never be attached. I&#x2019;m trying to find a
 balance, trying to find my way, and every choice I&#x2019;ve ever made brings me
 anywhere but home. But I&#x2019;ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms, and I will never
 regret my decision. This is the only thing I have worth holding on to. This is
 the only thing that makes me feel alive. I&#x2019;ve simply been searching for the
 right place to rest my head. I&#x2019;m searching for common ground between all that I
 am, and all that you need me to be. I&#x2019;ve seen a future and want nothing to do
 with it. A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared. I&#x2019;m
 struggling but I won&#x2019;t allow myself to sink. You know where to find me. I keep
 my composure and assume my place, in front of the people I love most. You&#x2019;re
 the reason why we&#x2019;re here. I&#x2019;m struggling, but I won&#x2019;t allow myself to sink.
