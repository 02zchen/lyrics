Everything ends, at least that&#x2019;s what we hope for. Plagued by our past and we&#x2019;re doomed to repeat ourselves. Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I&#x2019;m just trying to feel something. Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted. You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence. You&#x2019;re nothing but a carcass. I&#x2019;ve never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep. You&#x2019;re the furthest thing from me, and you&#x2019;ve been there from the start. An empty shell, you&#x2019;re vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris. Fortunately, I know that I&#x2019;m not worth it. Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone. Why did I think that this time it&#x2019;d be different? I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions. I tried by hardest but I couldn&#x2019;t make you feel a fucking thing.
