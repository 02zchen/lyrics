Expose me for all that I am. The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness. Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind&#x2026; and will I ever really let it come to surface? You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you&#x2019;re told. Serenity is a beautiful hoax. A liar. I have the whole world convinced of my contentment. No truth in this. I&#x2019;ve lost count of all the times I made it home alive&#x2026;and wished I hadn&#x2019;t. Expose me for all that I am. The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness. I&#x2019;m left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker. Life is what&#x2019;s killing me. I hate the fact that I&#x2019;m just fine. Forever seeking something to take responsibility. Life is what&#x2019;s killing me. I hate the fact that I&#x2019;m alive. Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality. At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn&#x2019;t want to die. I&#x2019;d work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds. But I know I&#x2019;d just be counting down the minutes until I&#x2019;m miserable again.
