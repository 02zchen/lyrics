I had a heart
But I buried it someplace
I had a brain
But my body won the race

I dream in pictures,
Pictures of you
A figure of eight
Just won't do

Oh yeah, oh yeah

You picked the fruit
That gave you a sweet taste
You walk the tightrope
Unwilling to see straight

You pick me up
Then you pull me down
Made up your mind
That I'm the clown

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked too much

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

You had a dream
And you thought it religious
You had a taste
And it made it contagious

It rips you up
Then it spits you out
Makes you know
What it's all about

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we took too much

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we took too much

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Was there tragedy, all we did?
Now I know there's no place for it.

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Was there tragedy in the things we did?
Now I know there's no place for it.

Oh yeah, oh yeah
