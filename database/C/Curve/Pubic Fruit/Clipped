Only in days, they get together
They're talking volumes and drink some coffee
Clipped for outdoors, clear and bright
They pour out on me their own true mankind

There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too

All he says causes scandal
I've heard it said that he's the original
Of the vandal
He steals your words
Clears our mind

There's no way you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way like accepting
There's no way, that's damn sure
There's no way you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure

Hopelessly untrue

There's no truth
There's no lies
There's no way you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure

There's no way you can move me
There's no way, damn sure
There's no truth
There's no lies
