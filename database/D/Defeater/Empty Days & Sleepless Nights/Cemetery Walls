Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

&#x201C;Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you.&#x201D;
You drink until you're sick.
&#x201C;I trace the grooves in your stone.&#x201D;
Plot where you'll bury him,
The man that left you alone.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

You drink until you're sick,
And feel the dew in the grass.
As the sun's coming up,
Watch a funeral pass.

&#x201C;Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you.&#x201D;
You think to yourself,
&#x201C;That should have been me.&#x201D;
Two in the family plot, but you wish it were three.

Climb those cemetery walls again; (climb those cemetery walls)
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again, (climb those cemetery walls)
You can't stand the sight of yourself.
