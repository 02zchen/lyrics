Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can&#x2019;t stand the sight of yourself.

&#x201C;Now that you&#x2019;re gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you.&#x201D;
You drink until you&#x2019;re sick.
&#x201C;I trace the grooves in your stone.&#x201D;
Plot where you&#x2019;ll bury him,
The man that left you alone.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can&#x2019;t stand the sight of yourself.

You drink until you&#x2019;re sick,
And feel the dew in the grass.
As the sun&#x2019;s coming up,
Watch a funeral pass.

&#x201C;Now that you&#x2019;re gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you.&#x201D;
You think to yourself,
&#x201C;That should have been me.&#x201D;
Two in the family plot, but you wish it were three.

Climb those cemetery walls again; (climb those cemetery walls)
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again, (climb those cemetery walls)
You can&#x2019;t stand the sight of yourself.
