&#x201C;Where were you every night that I woke up alone?&#x201D;
Cold sweat keeps you up.
&#x201C;This ain't no kind of home.&#x201C;

&#x201C;Come pick me up.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Damn those boys at the bar,
Damn the way that you drink.&#x201D;
Cold sweat, sleepless nights,
When your hands start to shake.
&#x201C;Damn that pier where you sit,
Damn your vengeance for him
There's no bringing him back,
Your father is buried and dead.&#x201D;

But you can't let go of that hero's death.
And you've been left with,
Left with his debt.

You couldn't fight for your country
And your mother is an addict.

&#x201C;How dare you?&#x201D;
&#x201C;This ain't no kind of home.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Come pick me up.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Damn that man that you humor,
He only wants one thing from you.
Damn those looks that you give him.
Parlor tricks and I'm played for a fool.&#x201D;

&#x201C;How dare you?&#x201D;
&#x201C;This ain't no kind of home.&#x201D;
