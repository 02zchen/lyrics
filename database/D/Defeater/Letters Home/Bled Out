I feel the distance in your letters sent
I left my family for the trenches
You&#x2019;ve got me worried about leaving
You&#x2019;ve got your needle, I&#x2019;ve got my demons
You&#x2019;ve got me homesick, I feel me slipping
I feel the cold hand of death is creeping
He took my brother to the ocean floor
I beg but death don&#x2019;t come, that fucking coward
I&#x2019;d give me life for his, what could I have done differently?
Bled out and failed him, he never would have done that to me

Let me keep sinking
Let me keep drowning
I am no one
I am nothing

I feel the distance in your letters sent
(I feel the distance)
I left my family for the trenches
(I am desperate)
You&#x2019;ve got me worried about leaving
(Got me homesick)
You&#x2019;ve got your needle, I&#x2019;ve got my demons
(I am hopeless)

And all I see is the bastard in me
