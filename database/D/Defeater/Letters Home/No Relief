Waking up safe and sound
The words could hardly leave my mouth
&#x201C;How did I make it out alive?&#x201D;
I lose the same sleep every night

&#x201C;How did I make it out alive?&#x201D;

I got your letter today
And when I heard my name
My stomach sank to the floor
I can't take any more
I'm digging my own grave

And it read &#x201C;Dear John&#x201D;
I knew this day would come
I'm drinking every drop
Until the aching will stop
Until you pull that rig out of your arm

A wise man once told me
There wil be no relief
We will never be free 
Of the horrible things 
And the pain that we've seen

And that same man was told

&#x201C;No matter where we may roam
You forget what you know of
That life you once lived
Because your home ain't never home&#x201D;

I got your letter today
And when I heard my name
My stomach sank to the floor
I can't take any more
I'm digging my own grave

And it read &#x201C;Dear John&#x201D;
I knew this day would come
I'm drinking every drop
Until the aching will stop
Until you pull that rig out of your arm

And it read &#x201C;Dear John&#x201D; 
I'm drinking every drop
Until the aching will stop
And it read &#x201C;Dear John&#x201D;
