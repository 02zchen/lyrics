Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle 
Now I&#x2019;m my mother&#x2019;s only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific

I find no comfort
I find no solace
I&#x2019;ve got no use for these

I find no closure
I find no peace
Just these scarred up memories

I&#x2019;ve got your letters
I&#x2019;ve got your good luck
In your rabbit foot I keep

Around my throat
To keep me from dying
You&#x2019;ve always been protecting me 

Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle 
Now I&#x2019;m my mother&#x2019;s only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific
