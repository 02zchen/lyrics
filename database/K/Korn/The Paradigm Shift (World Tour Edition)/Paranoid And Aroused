Help me, I am freaking, and my heart is barely beating
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking, and my lungs are barely breathing as the angels put me into the ground

And everybody&#x2019;s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

Slap me, I am shaking, and my guts are really aching
And the demons, they&#x2019;re laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading, and my will is dissipating as the angels put me into the ground.

And everybody&#x2019;s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

My mind is debating, these lesions I&#x2019;m making
This mess is sedating, the power embracing
The bullshit I&#x2019;m facing, my feelings, I'm hating
Reality is failing, this shit is degrading

And everybody&#x2019;s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

The bullshit I'm facing, my feelings, I'm hating
Reality, it's failing
This shit is degrading
