How come, what&#x2019;s wrong with you?
Darling faces all come frowns
Let&#x2019;s do what devils do, hang each other when no one&#x2019;s around
Why can&#x2019;t I torture you?
Giving pain, then you take it away
The little things you do, simply, I love your evil ways
(Your ways, your ways, your ways)

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow, you bring the violence out in me
I&#x2019;m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

This virus follows you
Nothing&#x2019;s left, you&#x2019;re dead on the ground
How can I covet you?
Give you Hell and you can&#x2019;t rebound
My soul infected you, blackened thoughts, they run through your head
The little things you do, simply, I wish you were dead
(Were dead, were dead, were dead)

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow, you bring the violence out in me
I&#x2019;m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) 
I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) 
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) 
I&#x2019;m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

Goodbye, so long, wish I could stay, but everything is all wrong
Goodbye, so long, wish I could stay, but everything is all wrong

Everything is all wrong
(Everything) 
Wrong, wrong
(Everything) 
Wrong

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow, you bring the violence out in me
I&#x2019;m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) 
I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) 
Somehow, you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) 
I&#x2019;m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
