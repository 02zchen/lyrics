I&#x2019;m walking on a razor blade
Careful not to cross the line
Every little step I take
It&#x2019;s punishment time
Now I&#x2019;m getting to the end of the blade
Slipping to the other side
Every little step I take
It&#x2019;s punishment time

Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind

I&#x2019;m hanging like a bat today
Crucified by design
Every little move I make
It&#x2019;s punishment time
Now I&#x2019;m sleeping on a bed of nails
They&#x2019;re breaking through one at a time
Cause every little move I make
The punishment&#x2019;s mine

Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind

I give and don&#x2019;t get
I try to my death
For something inside me
That makes me forget 

Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There&#x2019;s no today
Fight or flight
I&#x2019;m losing my mind

Losing my mind! (x6)
