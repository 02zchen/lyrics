Our lives are fake, they mean nothing, you see
Our dreams are lost, just a fantasy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means nothing to me

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads

Our hearts are free
Does that mean anything?
Do what we&#x2019;re told, self-seeking hypocrisy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means fuck to me

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads

Black veil, it&#x2019;s coming for me, it&#x2019;s coming for me, it&#x2019;s coming for me
It&#x2019;s coming for me, it&#x2019;s the black veil of insanity, it&#x2019;s coming for me
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads
