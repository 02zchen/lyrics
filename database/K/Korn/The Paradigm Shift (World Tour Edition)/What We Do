Sometimes things get in the way, my thoughts I cannot convey
It&#x2019;s all pointing straight at you
We hate loving everyday
Our lives, twirled in every way, I give it all back to you

I can&#x2019;t help this going down

I can&#x2019;t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That&#x2019;s what we do, we do

Sometimes, things don&#x2019;t go away
In turn, you just run away
It&#x2019;s all coming back for you, betrayed, life is in decay
Your thoughts you cannot obey
Right now, whatcha gonna do?

I can&#x2019;t help this going down

I can&#x2019;t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That&#x2019;s what we do, we do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger
He&#x2019;s all alone and no one gets his anger
I feel this pain everytime I&#x2019;m here with you, with you
All the heartache and the fucked up insults
I find you begging on your knees, I figured
This is how it&#x2019;s supposed to be with you, with you

I can&#x2019;t wait for your lies to be broken down
I gave you Hell

I can't take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That&#x2019;s what we do
I can&#x2019;t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That&#x2019;s what we do
