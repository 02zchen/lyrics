Let me tell y'all a story
About a rookie spacecadet
He were down on a Sigma planet
With his platoon in a swamp
Suddenly the bugs were coming
Hunting down them all
First one to go was the young LG
He ended in the jaws
Of some giant beetle
It tore him up in pieces
And ate him still alive

???????
Ran into the swamp
Laying in a goo
He heard beetween the fear?
Suddenly the screech were gone
His strengths had disappeared
Then he heard the sound behind him
??? the meanest god
But it was a giant soldier
That he'd never seen before
He made a gesture with his hand
The rookie had to follow
He said, my friends just call me Sarge

Running through a swamp
Like in a theme of green
The bugs were coming at them
So they had to stop and fight
The rookie couldn't move
And the Sergaent? fought his? own
The one he didn't see
Just slapped over his knee
They were hurting him a lot
But he just ignored the pain

The bravest ?thing? he'd ever seen
The rook forgot his fear
The ruthless gun in Sargeant's hand
Back-to-back they fought all night
'til the bugs gave up and ran
When all the bugs had gone
And the dawn was breaking through
Sarge took up and left
Get a beer on me, he said
He tossed the rookie coin
With an extraordinary glow

The rookie, he got (bagged?) banged and canned
With another bug inside (in sight)
He returned from the patrol
As the only man alive
He continued to the captain
To report that he was back
After ??? some sleep
He walked into the mess
Nun took notes/notice? off him
So he just walked up to a bar
The coin drop on the counter
Can I get a beer, he asked
The soldier got/gulped? his drink
You could hear a needle drop
The coin was shining still
With that extraordinary glow
Silently they looked at him
Realizing something wrong
The Corporal at the bar
Just gave the rookie beer
He looked at him and said
Let me tell you about the Sarge
On the first partol he lost his group
To the bugs out in the swamp
Just couldn't stand the thought
So he ate his .45
Though he's dead he's gotta fight
Forever on his own
He will never get no rest
'til the bugs has disappeared
He looked at a jar of coins
Standing on a shelf
They looked like just the rookie's
With an extraordinary glow
The rookie took his coin
And put it in a jar

The bravest ?thing? he'd ever seen
The rook forgot his fear
The ruthless gun in Sargeant's hand
Back-to-back they fought all night
'til the bugs gave up and ran
When all the bugs had gone
And the dawn was breaking through
Sarge took up and left
Get a beer on me, he said
He tossed the rookie coin
With an extraordinary glow
