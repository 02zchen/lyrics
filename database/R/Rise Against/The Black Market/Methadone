Love like a needle full of methadone
Potent but not real, left you wanting more

Lipstick track marks bleeding wet
Like Montagues and Capulets
For us child the stars refuse to shine
Oh why for us, child, do the stars refuse to shine?

Somewhere strung out on the lam
We wound up back here again
Like unstable chemicals
Combining only to explode

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world's a fuse
So don&#x2019;t get close
Trouble and the worth
Am I better off on my own?

Contaminated, quarantined then left alone
A shipment refused, address unknown
A damaged goods they soon forget
The choking dust that we got left
For us all, the stars refuse to shine

Tap the vein and light the match
We burn like stars before the crash
But for you there&#x2019;s still a chance
Just let go

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world's a fuse
So don&#x2019;t get close
Trouble and the worth
I&#x2019;m better off on my own
On my own

Now there&#x2019;s nowhere to run
And yeah there&#x2019;s nowhere to hide
There&#x2019;s nothing under the sun
We haven&#x2019;t already tried

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a hand grenade, pin already pulled so don&#x2019;t let go
As we chase the sun my shadow slows us down
And without me along, you&#x2019;re better off and I know
You&#x2019;re better off and I know
And I know
