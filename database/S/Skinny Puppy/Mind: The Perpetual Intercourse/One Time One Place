Metal rain collapse
Crawls out
Which way the will go
Harness to ever last
Wallowing to test the past
A truth
At times so shallow
Develop an attitude
More time
Decay
Lapse in
Fortify thyself
Cut off
Inbred and forever more

What a way to end the game

Failing
Bleeding eyes
Caricature of pain
Distant
So distant
Melting in the rain

Cold war
Flies forth on wings of destruction
An orgy of missile tests
A mortifying flash
Huddled
Round the radio-active
Console to control
The lives of the young
Levels of toxic waste
Disgrace
Yet tolerant
Of all that's been done
Built up for a future race
A race that's never won

Falling from on high
Meet the maker's face
Distort forget time
Forever leave this place

An atom fuse
Shortens with man's progression
Decipher what's relative
A legal bureaucrat
Motions with a tender finger
Who's poverties
And who's will be next
Man in a cave
Further action left at that
Two gaping holes
A dripping carnivore
Nature's regret
The law of things so brutalized
An enemy that need not

What a way to end the game

Third world
Make peace
A visionary
Repress the weak
Repress the weak
Repress, repress

That's all there is

A hint of gleam
A halo of old jaded weakness
Corruption runs harmonious
Taken by extremes
Doorway
Extinction pleases
Repression is based on love
For all length of time
Full of elemental powers
Inbred and not brilliant
No fortune could buy this
