The wind is blowin' beer cans down a cold deserted street
I feel as empty as those beer cans rollin' past my feet
I can hear Chicago blues from an out of tune guitar
And a 1939 neon sign buzzin' above the bar

I'm at an intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love
She left me on the corner of lust and love

I got an old tattoo dedicated to you covered up with thorns
But the heart bleeds through and your name does too forever on my arm
Each night I go walkin' through the darkness all alone
But I never get of that dirty old street no matter how far I roam

I'm at an intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love
She left me on the corner of lust and love

Underneath the street light I strain my eyes to see
The silhouette's reflection of a long black mercury
Shadows on the pavement from the corners of my eye
Fool me into thinkin' my baby's passin' by

Intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love

She left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love
Left me on the corner of lust and love

Left me on the corner of lust and love
