Sittin' by myself, lookin' out a broken window
And out on the street crowds of people passin' by
But how are they to know I'm feeling so alone
I feel like I could break down and cry

Now I know how broken hearts must feel

But my heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar it's true
The flame keep on burnin', burnin' so high
Never gonna die

Sittin' all alone, feelin' sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kinda fool I've been
But how was I to know I had to let you go?
The only way to make it alright

Now you've lit the flame again

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar it's true
The flame keep on burnin', burnin' so high
It's never gonna die

Sometimes I think, I pass you by
But it's just love blinding my eyes

Sittin' all alone, feelin' sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kinda fool I've been
But how was I to know I had to let you go
The only way to make it alright

Now you've lit the flame again

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it's true
The flame keeps burnin', burnin' so high
Never gonna die, no-no!

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar it's true
The flame keeps burnin', burnin' so high
Never gonna die
