I can&#x2019;t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn&#x2019;t matter where I&#x2019;ve been. Can&#x2019;t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it&#x2019;s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

I&#x2019;ve been here one time, two times, now three times before.
Long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door.
I&#x2019;m staring at the face of doubt so I can&#x2019;t forget who I&#x2019;m cutting out.
Why put in my all just to watch my buildings fall?

Hey, hey, I&#x2019;m living for today.
Forgetting things I can&#x2019;t change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

It all comes down to this. Both truth and consequence.
I need something more than an empty promise.
To believe in something, just one thing, that will never go wrong, not today.
Letdown after letdown, I&#x2019;m done.

Hey, hey, I&#x2019;m living for today.
Forgetting things I can&#x2019;t change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

Count the clock till the overhaul.
You built a bomb inside my walls.
Count the clock till we&#x2019;re out of hand.
You build, build now we&#x2019;re caught in the avalanche.

Reset, rebuild. You wrecked this city but not my will.
