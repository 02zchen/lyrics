We&#x2019;re from a long line of people running from themselves.
Let&#x2019;s look alive. The sun is blocked out from sight. All days turn to night.
I&#x2019;m done running from myself. I speak for no one else. No.
Everyday in succession. Until we come undone. Nah.

This is me. This is you.
Yeah, we&#x2019;re coming unglued.
Like a page pulled from the bind.

I can&#x2019;t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn&#x2019;t matter where I&#x2019;ve been. Can&#x2019;t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it&#x2019;s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

What you see is what they want you to see.
You&#x2019;ve got to learn that for yourself and not from me.
Lessons learned in a lifetime. Sleep with an open eye. What&#x2019;s yours ain&#x2019;t mine.
No matter what we&#x2019;re gonna pull through. Just like we always do. Yeah, ain&#x2019;t that the truth.

This is me. This is you.
Riding on a fault line.
Yeah, as we divide.

I can&#x2019;t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn&#x2019;t matter where I&#x2019;ve been. Can&#x2019;t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it&#x2019;s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

Once more into the fray.
Once more doing what&#x2019;s expected of me until it ends.
It ends as it begun. Then our work is done&#x2026;
