For whom the bell tolls.

There&#x2019;s a hurricane raging inside me. The second wave is right there behind me.
Don&#x2019;t leave me alone, as this fire burns whole. Before there&#x2019;s nothing left to atone.
Breathe new life into me. Send waves to crash right through me.
I wear the perfect disguise, right behind my eyes.

Its got me coming undone.
My facade made of stone. I&#x2019;m deep beneath now, I need to let go.
This life has taken it&#x2019;s toll. I can&#x2019;t be myself pleasing everyone else. No!

First one up in line when there is hell to pay. Filthy hands that never wash away.
This is one time I won&#x2019;t being subjective.
I need to see things from a brand new perspective.

Because I&#x2019;m coming undone.
My facade made of stone. I&#x2019;m deep beneath, now I need to let go.
This life has taken it&#x2019;s toll. I can&#x2019;t be myself pleasing everyone else. No!

I&#x2019;d like to think I&#x2019;d never cave in. A vicious battle I may never win.
And I&#x2019;d like to think I&#x2019;ll come out stronger. Life&#x2019;s swinging hard but I&#x2019;m swinging harder.

For whom the bell tolls.
&#x201C;I have an inheritance from my father, it&#x2019;s the moon and the sun.
And although that I roam all over the world, the spending&#x2019;s never done.&#x201D;

My facade made of stone. I&#x2019;m deep beneath, now I need to let go.
This life has taken it&#x2019;s toll. I can&#x2019;t be myself pleasing everyone else. No!
