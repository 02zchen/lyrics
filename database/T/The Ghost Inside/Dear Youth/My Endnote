Consider this my endnote to be read when I&#x2019;m gone.
I have always been looking for this, dying for this, but It seems I&#x2019;ve lost track.
This is everything I believed in. This is what I&#x2019;ll take back.

We won&#x2019;t compete. I won&#x2019;t fight for a throne that doesn&#x2019;t exist.
We won&#x2019;t compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won&#x2019;t compete. I won&#x2019;t fight for a throne that doesn&#x2019;t exist.
We won&#x2019;t compete. It&#x2019;s only us who feel the consequence.

I choose to start today because I&#x2019;m longing for a life less plagued.
Where we both know, that if we both go, then we leave behind an empty page.

Why would I fight a war when I&#x2019;ve lost everything I&#x2019;m fighting for?
Why do you turn your head when together we could wake the dead?

This is not beyond repair.
This is a certainty. This is a must for me.
Because it&#x2019;s not beyond repair.

We won&#x2019;t compete. I won&#x2019;t fight for a throne that doesn&#x2019;t exist.
We won&#x2019;t compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won&#x2019;t compete. I won&#x2019;t fight for a throne that doesn&#x2019;t exist.
We won&#x2019;t compete. It&#x2019;s only us who feel the consequence.

You can&#x2019;t break me.
I have taken the stand and I have earned my place.
Those who breed disgrace remain faceless.

With my head held high, I&#x2019;ll give until I am gone. You can&#x2019;t break me.
With my head held high, I&#x2019;ve been here all along. You can&#x2019;t break me.
