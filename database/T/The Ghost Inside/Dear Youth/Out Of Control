It appears that we can&#x2019;t rely on common sense.
Let&#x2019;s act our age and turn the page on this intolerance.
Because we&#x2019;re not meant to live like this. By-products of ignorance.

This is out of control, it&#x2019;s out of control, it&#x2019;s gotta go. You&#x2019;re scared of what you don&#x2019;t know.
I&#x2019;ll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

Always failing to be accepting cause hatred stems from uncertainty.
Speaking down from above casts a shadow on the ones in search of the sun.
You think you&#x2019;re better than me? Your words of &#x201C;wisdom&#x201D; are spreading disease.
But you won&#x2019;t get the better of me. Walk in these shoes before you trample my feet.

This is out of control, it&#x2019;s out of control, it&#x2019;s gotta go. You&#x2019;re scared of what you don&#x2019;t know.
I&#x2019;ll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

We tear each other down to build ourselves up. A system failure, enough is enough.
&#x201C;Cause in a world this shaky and unstable, we&#x2019;ve got to be less fucking hateful.&#x201D;
Knuckles white. This is beyond aggression.
Knuckles white. Because we need new direction.

This is out of control, it&#x2019;s out of control, it&#x2019;s gotta go. You&#x2019;re scared of what you don&#x2019;t know.
I&#x2019;ll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

This is out of control. I&#x2019;ll say this over again.
A house divided will never stand.
