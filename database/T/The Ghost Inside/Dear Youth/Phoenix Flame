Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe.

I&#x2019;ll never be what you think I should be. No, not today.
I&#x2019;ll never say all the things I should say. I&#x2019;m only human.

More often than not, you&#x2019;re gonna feel alone.
It&#x2019;s a long fall from the top. Can you stand it?
Gave it all that I&#x2019;ve got everywhere I roamed.
I can&#x2019;t do this alone, can you help me?

This is how it ends. We fall, we mend.
Burn and start again. Rebuild, forget.
Lest we forget.

Breathe in, breathe out.
