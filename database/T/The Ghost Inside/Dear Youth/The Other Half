We believe in a system that has long been broken.
We turn the other cheek without a glimpse of emotion.
Always looking out for number one. Why do you need more while others have none?

Measure my worth by what I&#x2019;ve done, not what I&#x2019;ve become.

I spanned the oceans. I&#x2019;ve seen the skies. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren&#x2019;t even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn&#x2019;t mean that you need.

We&#x2019;ve come so far from the lives that we&#x2019;re meant to live.
But there&#x2019;s so much more that I have left to give.
We always borrow time that can&#x2019;t be given back.
We let it slip away and never pick up the slack.

I spanned the oceans. I&#x2019;ve seen the skies. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren&#x2019;t even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn&#x2019;t mean that you need.

Force fed and misled. Now we hang by a thread.
Force fed and misled. But not me, I see red.

You need to hear this.
Measure my worth by what I&#x2019;ve done, not what I&#x2019;ve become.
Are you listening?
Measure my worth by what I&#x2019;ve done, not what I&#x2019;ve become.

I&#x2019;ve spanned the oceans. I&#x2019;ve seen the skies. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life aren&#x2019;t even things at all.
But they&#x2019;re the things that keep my heart full.
