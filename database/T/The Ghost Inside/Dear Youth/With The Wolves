Somewhere along the way we got thrown off track.
Though we tried so hard to keep ourselves in check.
We&#x2019;ve grown so used to this lack of sleep. Exhausted from an overwhelming defeat.

Whoa, I can&#x2019;t find my way.
There&#x2019;s no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I&#x2019;ve given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.

So I sing these words to the fortunate. The ones who look alive.
Never living life in disconnect, through someone else&#x2019;s eyes.

Whoa, I can&#x2019;t find my way.
There&#x2019;s no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I like a fool, am burned. I give and give with no return.

Whoa, there&#x2019;s no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I&#x2019;ve given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.

Nothing will be earned by skipping stones.
Lessons won&#x2019;t be learned through broken bones.
One by one, we&#x2019;re losing ourselves.
Like a flame burning out, but I have a light.
When you&#x2019;re in the dark and out of doubt, find me.

God, what have I done?
I&#x2019;ve lost myself for no one.

Whoa, I can&#x2019;t find my way.
There&#x2019;s no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I like a fool, am burned. I give and give with no return.

Whoa, there&#x2019;s no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I&#x2019;ve given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.
