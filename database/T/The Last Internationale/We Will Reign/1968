You wait for fallen angels
We don't need no miracles
We seize on every moment
Come baby, ride this movement!

Do you think they really love you?
As they kill and rise above you?
Will they don't really love us?
They can never really love!

The more I love
the more I feel I can make it revolution
the more I make revolutoion
the more I feel I can make it love

We're not revolutionaries
Sit around and talking pennies
We speak in a different fashion
Our language is direct action

For everyone who to stop us
We multiply three or four
Noone or one could stop us
Cut down on he killing floor

The more I love
The more I feel I can make it revolution
The more I make revolutoion
The more I feel I can make it love

Do you think they really love you?
As they kill and rise above you?
Do you think they really love us?
As they kill and rise above us?

Will they don't really love us?
Will they can really love us?
Will they won't really love us?
They can never really love!

The more I love
The more I feel I can make it revolution
The more I make revolutoion
The more I feel I can make it love

The more I make revolutoion
The more I feel I can make it love
