All my life I've been fightin' fear
Been dragged down, buried in this world alone
The sounds of thunder I could always hear
Had me feelin' so sick, I called this hell "my home"

I left my lovin' and everything behind
I know where I'm going', won't be turned around
Until it breaks it holdin' down the line
'Til we are free from the marching sound

I know what is true
I know what to do with it
I'll see it 'til it's through

Hold your battleground
Whilst the cameras sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round

I'm young and furious, with a fist of stone
Learnt to stand on my feet, but this is not my land
I see my reflection and I'm not alone
We'll take it all instead of what we can

We know what is true
We know what to do
And we'd defend it until it's blue

Hold your battleground
Whilst the cameras sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round

Tell me I feel
We'll be moved or be turned around
Tell me I'm free
We'll keep on rising to the marching sound
The marching sound

Hold your battleground
Where the cameras sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round
