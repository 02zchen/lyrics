Gotta hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Oh, believe it...

Woke up feeling lonely
There's always something to be missed
I don't know if he regrets
Pricking me with that kiss

Devil come knocking
Don't have the strength to resist
I wanna lay it all down, but
Voice tells me "this ain't it"

Say you gotta hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Oh, believe it...

Woke up feeling lonely
There's always someone to be missed
I don't know if he remembers
Breaking me with that kiss

When the devil come knocking
I'll have the strength to resist
But I don't care if he regrets it
I'll make him pay for what he did

Hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Well, hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Oh

Hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Well, carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Well, hold that fire
For you lay that burden down
Yeah, carry it higher
For you lay that burden down

Oh
