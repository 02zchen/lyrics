Pick me up when you're coming down
Pull me in or put me out
I'll be gone 'til your heart is lost for me

Lost for me
You'll be lost for me

'Cause when the light that you're holding
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it's better not to sit outside
So goodnight my baby, I'm not your fire
Keep on... I'll be alright

Love me through the harshest winter
Break my blues with your warmest summer
Hold my hand in the hardest rain
We will dance with atoms in the air
Spin until we land anywhere
Then I'll be gone 'til your heart is lost for me

Lost for me
You'll be lost for me

'Cause when the light that you're holding
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it's better not to sit outside
So goodnight my baby, I'm not your fire
Keep on... I'll be alright

When the light that you're holding
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it's better not to sit outside
So goodnight my baby, I'm not your fire
Keep on... I'll be alright

Oh...
Alright, oh, I'll be alright
Keep on
Keep on... I'll be alright
