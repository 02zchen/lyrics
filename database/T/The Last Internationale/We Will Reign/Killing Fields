You walk around with your head in the ground
You talking loud but don't make a sound
You can't speak to power in the killing field

You think that flower power will make them stop
Bang-bang-bang baby, here come the cops!
Power is power, love, no matter who's on top (yeah)
Hush now baby, you're in a killing field

Hey!

They want you to toe those party lines
They ain't got the tools
I ain't got the time
We'll take all your money
And leave your children behind

Ooh

You think that flower power will make them stop,
Bang-bang-bang baby, here come the cops!
Power is power, love, no matter who's on top (yeah)
Hush now baby, you're in a killing field

Hey

Now listen baby, 'cause I know it's hard
It could be Gandhi or the Son of God
Love, power is power, no matter who's on top

Ay!

You think that flower power will make them stop
Bang-bang-bang baby, here come the cops!
Power is power, love, no matter who's on top

Yea

Hush now baby, you're in a killing field

Hush now baby, you're in a killing field
