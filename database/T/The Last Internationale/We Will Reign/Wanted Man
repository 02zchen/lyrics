I've been fighting for so long
In the shade it is my home
I've been killing whether right or wrong

'Tween two sides I'm drawn and owned
And a thought that has left me alone
I am noone and I'll die unknown

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo

The road behind has disappeared
Drowned in the memories of your tears
And the shadow but it's still too near

No one to trust or choose to speak
I am the enemy that I fear
Lord forgive me when the smoke clears

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
Yeah, you will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
A wanted man
Yeah, you will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
A wanted man
Yeah, you will run
And you'll die a wanted man

I've been fighting for so long
In the shade it is my home
I've been killing whether right or wrong
