I know I've heard it then that we might have seen it all
We're building walls and we love to see them fall
We've learned to walk but the spirit in us crawls

It's all been written, it's all been sung
We cannot hide what's been coming all along
And after all that's left of reign of right or wrong

Someway, someplace
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
I'll make it there with you

We will reign
We will reign

We're always saying that it's always almost over
Why does it take a war to bring us closer?
And love is truer when times are getting colder

Someway, someplace
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
I'll make it there with you
I'll be there with you

We will reign

Someway, someplace
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where but I'm going there with you
I'll make it there with you

We will reign
We will reign
We will reign
We will reign
We will reign
