I know to be there
When and where, I&#x2019;ll be there
You know what&#x2019;s to be said
We said out loud, we never said

My &#x1E57;remonition of the world comes to me
A sun in your hands from the middle life
Says I&#x2019;m alright

You said you don&#x2019;t have to speak
I can hear you
I can&#x2019;t feel all the things you've ever felt before

I said it&#x2019;s been a long time
Since someone looked at me that way
It&#x2019;s like you knew me
And all the things I couldn't say

Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be

Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be

Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be

Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
